# Binary-Perceptron
Training a Perceptron

We create an artificial data set that is separated into two general locations. We then define and train a percpetron to trace a regression line between the two distinct locations. We can then make preditions about new data points by checking whether they lie above or below the regression line.

Note: we use an order-1 polynomial. This is not required, as one can choose any order that is appropriate; however, overfitting will likely be an issue. In that case, implement dropout or another technique to reduce overfitting.
